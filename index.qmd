title: "Calc I & II at University of Austin"
subtitle: "Prof. Daniel Kaplan"

This is the home page for the Winter and Spring terms of the course sequence Calc I/II at UATX. 
But from here on, assignments due *before class* are really due before class. Similarly, the *readings* should be completed before class (which will put you in a position to answer the reading questions). When you have questions about a reading, let's make it part of a class discussion on the day the reading is due.

## Schedule: Near future

**Orientation**: For simplicity, most class days will be structured in the same way:

- Often, we will cover one chapter of *MOSAIC Calculus* each class days. Some chapters may take longer.
- We will discuss the reading in class, so you should do the reading and hand in the reading questions *before* that class. 
- You can go back, re-do, and re-submit the reading questions if you like, but this is not required.
- The assignment for each chapter will be due the class day *following* the discussion of that chapter. If you have questions, bring them to that following day to discuss them, then you can complete your assignment.
