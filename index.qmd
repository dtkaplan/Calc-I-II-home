This is the home page for both terms of the two-term UATX/MOSAIC Calculus sequence. The course has no specific pre-requisites and is suited both to those who have no previous experience with Calculus and those who have taken an AP or IB year-long calculus sequence. The UATX Calculus sequence is designed to replace the entire multi-term traditional sequence---Calc I, II, III, differential equations, linear algebra---for STEM students and is highly relevant to economics, biology and medicine, data science, public policy, physics, and chemistry. It does not emphasize "pure" (theoretical) mathematics or proof.

Please read the [**Basics**](basics.html) page for course policies and such.

## Course outline

* First term (10 weeks, winter term)

    1. [Preliminaries](https://www.mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/Textbook/preliminaries-part.html): Quantities, spaces, functions, notation, computing
    2. [Modeling](https://www.mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/Textbook/modeling-part.html): General techniques used in constructing models, that is, building mathematical representations of real-world objects.
    3. [Differentiation](https://www.mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/Textbook/differentiation-part.html)/anti-differentiation and applications of derivatives.

* Second term (10 weeks, spring term)

    1. [Linear algebra](https://www.mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/Textbook/linear-combinations-part.html) (approx 3 weeks). High-dimensional spaces and their residents, projection, decomposition, transformation
    2. [Accumulation](https://www.mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/Textbook/accumulation-part.html) (approx 3 weeks). Taking information about change of state and turning it into information about state.
    3. [Dynamics](https://www.mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/Textbook/dynamics-part.html) (approx 3 weeks). Modeling state as it evolves in time.
