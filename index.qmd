------

This is the home page for both terms of the two-term UATX/MOSAIC Calculus sequence. The course has no specific pre-requisites and is suited both to those who have no previous experience with Calculus and those who have taken an AP or IB year-long calculus sequence. The UATX Calculus sequence is designed to replace the entire multi-term traditional sequence---Calc I, II, III, differential equations, linear algebra---for STEM students and is highly relevant to economics, biology and medicine, data science, public policy, physics, and chemistry but does not emphasize "pure" (theoretical) mathematics or proof.

Please read the [**Basics**](basics.html) page for course policies and such. 

------

All of us are busy people and need to regulate how much time we spend on each activity. For UATX calculus, make sure to complete the readings and reading questions. The chapter-by-chapter exercises are also important for learning and as a component of the grade, but you are not obliged (unless otherwise stated) to do *all* the exercises. More is better. Exercises marked as "in-class" are not required homework.

## Day-by-day schedule

::: {.callout-note}
## 7. Tuesday 21 January

Topics: Graphics and parameters.

Reading: *MOSAIC Calculus* [Chapter 7]() & [Chapter 8]() and their associated reading questions. Why two chapters in one day? As it happens, Chap. 7 is a rehash of what you have already seen about graphing data from the QR2 course.

Start on exercises for Chaps. 7 & 8. Due Thurs and Fri respectively
