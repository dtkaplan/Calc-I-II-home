<!-- matrix-1 -->

What kind of mathematical object will the following produce?

$$\left(\begin{array}{r} 
-8 & 4 & 8 \\ 
-9 & 2 & 7 \\ 
3 & 8 & 2 \\ 
6 & 5 & -8 \\ 
\end{array}\right) \times 
\left(\begin{array}{r} 
-1 \\ 
0 \\ 
-5 \\ 
4 \\ 
\end{array}\right)$$

```{mcq}
#| label: mcq-matrix-1
#| inline: true
#| show_hints: true
1. A scalar
2. A column vector
3. A row vector
4. A matrix with three columns
5. A matrix with three rows
6. It's meaningless. [correct hint: There are only three vectors in the matrix but the vector has four elements, meaning that it is looking to combine four vectors.]
