::: {#exr-solve-diag-system}
By hand, solve this matrix equation for $\vec{\bf x}$:
$$\left(\begin{array}{r} 
3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -4 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 
\end{array}\right)  \left(\begin{array}{r} 
x_1 \\ 
x_2 \\ 
x_3 \\ 
x_4 \\ 
x_5 \\ 
\end{array}\right)\ = \ 
\left(\begin{array}{r} 
6 \\ 
-5 \\ 
-7 \\ 
2 \\ 
-5 \\ 
\end{array}\right)$$

Enter your value for $\vec{\bf x}$ in Chunk A, then create the diagonal $\bf M$ matrix, as shown. Confirm by printing them out that both are what you expect them to be. Then computer multiply ${\bf M}$ by $\vec{\bf x}$ to confirm that your answer was correct.

```{webr-r}
#| caption: Chunk A
x <- vec( your_values_here )
M <- diag(c(6, -5, -7, 2, -5))
M %*% x
```
