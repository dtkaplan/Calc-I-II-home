Look at `head(M)` on the random matrix ${\bf M}$ produced by the following chunk. The number of rows in ${\bf M}$ is made to match `Galton`, while `k` sets the number of columns.

```{webr-r}
k = 3
Random <- rnorm(nrow(Galton) * k)
M <- matrix(Random, nrow = nrow(Galton))
dim(M)
head(M)
Galton |> model_train(height ~ M) |> R2()
```

$\bf M$ contains no genuine explanatory information about `height` and, correspondingly, R^2^ is small and the p-value is large.

Use successively higher values for `k` taking note of the corresponding R^2^ and p-values.

Can you choose `k` to get an R^2^ greater than 0.5? How about 0.99? Explain what's going on in terms of the dimension of the space spanned by ${\bf M}$.
