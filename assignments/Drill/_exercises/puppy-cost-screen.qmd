Here's a matrix M

1. Implement M and b in the chunk. 
2. Calculate `bhat`, the projection of `b` onto `M`
3. Find the residual, that is `b - bhat`.
4. If the length of the residual is zero, then the vectors in M span a space that includes b. In general, the vector analog to the statistical R^2^ is the length of `bhat` divided by the length of `b`. If R^2^ is zero, there is no residual. If R^2^ is 1, `b` is orthogonal to the space spanned by M.
