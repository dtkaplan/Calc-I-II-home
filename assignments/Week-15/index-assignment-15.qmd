DRAFT

for a possible solar power problem 
For instance, if I had a function ('solarpanelpower') that calculates the amount of power a solar panel generates and another function ('sunlight') that tells me the amount of sunlight at time of the day ('TOD'). I could evaluate this in one step like the following: 'solarpanelpower(sunlight(TOD))'. This would give me the amount of power from the solar panel based upon the time of the day.
