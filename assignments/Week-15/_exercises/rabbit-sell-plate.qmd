Look at [Figure 35.1 in *MOSAIC Calculus*](https://www.mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/Accumulation/35-integration.html#initial-value-of-the-quantity)

Notice that the zero-crossings of $f()$ each are an argmax or argmin of the anti-derivative $F()$. Explain why.

## Answer
If we have a function $F(t)$ and want to find the argmaxes or argmins, a procedure is to differentiate $\partial_t F(t)$ and look for the zero crossings. If $F()$ is the anti-derivative of $f()$, then $f()$ must be the derivative of $F()$.
