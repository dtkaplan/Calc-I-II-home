When you have questions about a reading, let’s make it part of a class discussion on the day the reading is due."

If you have questions, bring them to that following day to discuss them, then you can complete your assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "section": "Chap 1: Quantity, function, space",
    "text": "Chap 1: Quantity, function, space\nThese are the big three concepts for our calculus course. Neither Newton nor Leibniz would recognize them for what they are. Calculus has evolved hugely since its invention, and continues to evolve.\n\nExample: Our calculus course is closely related to the methods used in machine learning and (so-called) artificial intelligence.\n\nQuantity: the amount of some “stuff.” Need to specify both the amount and the kind of stuff.\n\nUnits tell us the kind of stuff.\n“Dimensions” is the framework for organizing units. It’s important to master this. Fundamental dimensions: L, T, M.\nDerived dimensions, e.g. L/T or L/T2, or M L2 / T2 are constructed by multiplying and dividing fundamental dimensions. Only multiplication and division are allowed!\nWe often have English words that correspond to specific dimensions, e.g. M L2 T-2 is “energy” while M L2 T-3 is “power.” Other, very common English dimension words: area, volume, flow, …\n\nFunction: in the calculus sense is a relationship between one or more inputs and a single output. You will learn about 20 vocabulary terms involving functions, some of which you already know. It is crucial to use the vocabulary precisely and accurately. Examples: input, domain, output, curvature, continuity, …\n\nNotation: Almost every function will have a name, e.g. sin, sqrt. We will usually write the name followed by a pair of empty parentheses to remind us that the name refers to a function.\nPutting inputs inside the parentheses means “evaluate the function for that input.” Example:\n\n\\(\\sin()\\) is the name of a function\n\\(\\sin(\\pi)\\) is a number, not a function.\nOften we will use names for the inputs to a function, especially when defining them, e.g., \\(f(x, t) \\equiv A \\exp(-t/T_0) \\sin(2\\pi t/P)\\).\n\nSurprising fundamental fact that you didn’t learn in high school. If \\(t\\) stands for time (say, units of seconds), then \\(\\sin(t)\\) is not a valid expression. We’ll see why later.\nA good, but partial definition of calculus is “the mathematics of functions.”\n\nSpace: This is at once completely intuitive and utterly incomprehensible. In a mathematical sense, a space is a “set of possibilities.” Each individual possibility is called a “point.”\nExamples: - A table-top is a space. You can put an object at any point on the table. - The stuff of the universe occupies space. Intuitively, this is 3-dimensional space, but relativists consider it to be 4-dimensional and string-theorists often talk about 9-dimensional space.\nCalculus is largely about state, change, and motion. A state is a point in the space. To change means to move from one point in the space to another. From any point, there is a set of independent directions in which you can move: e.g. left-right, forward-back, up-down. The number of such independent directions is called the “degrees of freedom” of the state."

To get anywhere, you have to decide what aspects of the situation are important. For instance, saying the state is a set of molecular positions and orientations would be unwieldy and impractical.\n“Important” is a subjective term and depends on the goals of the modeler. A good place to start when constructing a model is to think about the people the model is intended to serve."
