Similarly, the readings should be completed before class (which will put you in a position to answer the reading questions). When you have questions about a reading, let’s make it part of a class discussion on the day the reading is due."

Some chapters may take longer.\nWe will discuss the reading in class, so you should do the reading and hand in the reading questions before that class.\nYou can go back, re-do, and re-submit the reading questions if you like, but this is not required.\nThe assignment for each chapter will be due the class day following the discussion of that chapter. If you have questions, bring them to that following day to discuss them, then you can complete your assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Tuesday 7 January, 2025\n\n\n\nTopics: Orientation to course resources\nReading:\n\nMOSAIC Calculus Preface\nMOSAIC Calculus Chap 1: Quantity, function, space and reading questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.
