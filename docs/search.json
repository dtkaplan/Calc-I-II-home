The course has no specific pre-requisites and is suited both to those who have no previous experience with Calculus and those who have taken an AP or IB year-long calculus sequence. The UATX Calculus sequence is designed to replace the entire multi-term traditional sequence—Calc I, II, III, differential equations, linear algebra—for STEM students and is highly relevant to economics, biology and medicine, data science, public policy, physics, and chemistry. It does not emphasize “pure” (theoretical) mathematics or proof.\nPlease read the Basics page for course policies and such.\nHomework submission link"
