## Where we are

We've been introducing new terms that we will employ throughout the semester, mostly with an eye to creating an explicit nomenclature and notation.

- **Fundamental concepts**: Quantity, Function, Space
- Model**ing**: The process of constructing a model. We will cover this systematically, but *not yet*.
- We will use two systems for notation:
    1. traditional, as you might see in the textbook reading.
    2. computing, to be used in constructing computer commands

I've taken pains to make the two systems of notation as similar as possible, but respect for tradition and the restrictions of computer language interpreters force some divergences.

**Elements of notation**:

- names: `x`, `y`, `t`, `rainfall`, `temp_{high}`. When writing a name in computer notation, do **not** use quotation marks.
- numerals: the character representation of a number.
- functions: f(), g(), h() are common pronouns, but we will use a lot of proper names for functions, e.g. `sin()`, `log()`, `dnorm()`. (`dnorm()` is a new one for you! Be patient.)
    i. I write the `()` after a function name to remind you that the thing being named is a function. 
    ii. A handful of functions are written in *infix* notation. Thus, `+` is a function name, but you use it as 3 + 2 with the two arguments on the different sides of the function name. This contrasts with *functional* notation which would look something like $plus(3, 2)$. Even on the computer, don't convert infix notation to functional notation. Infix is usually easier to read (so long as there are just a handful of operators.)
- defining mathematical functions. When modeling, we will be creating and using mathematical functions. We will also be building computing expressions using computer functions. 
- traditional notation to define a function named henry(): $\text{henry}(t) \equiv t^2 / \sin(2\pi t/P)$
- *computer notation*: `henry <- makeFun(t^2 / sin(2*pi*t/P))`
- Note that the computer notation doesn't have "implicit multiplication." You must use the `*` infix operator.

## Computing with R

### Chunks for composing commands

In your own work, you will use *interactive* boxes---called "chunks" or "webr chunks"---to construct commands and, by pressing the "Run Code" button, get the computer to process them and appropriately display the results. It looks like this:

![](webr-chunk.png)

In writing up notes, I often use a different system that looks like this, without a "Run Code" button.

```{r}
2 + 3
```

In both styles, the output is reported with some formatting. The content of the output in the above chunks is 5. Often, output will have more than one component and the `[1]` is just telling you that the 5 is the first component.

You'll also sometimes see me using a different interface, called "RStudio," where I type commands in a console or in a document. You don't need to worry about this.

You cannot create on your own a webr chunk. I create them in the process of writing documents that you use. For instance, here is one:

```{webr-r}
15 + 98
```

But you can use a webr-chunk for any purpose that you like. Feel free to erase whatever expression has been typed and put in your own.

**NB**: Use the Calc I/II webr chunks for calculus, and the QR2 webr chunks for QR2. It would have been possible to arrange things so that you could use any chunk for any course, but I haven't thought this necessary. 

IN-CLASS EXERCISES:

Do some arithmetic and simple function application in R:

1. $\frac{22 - 5}{7}$
2. $4.14\! \times\! 10^{-3} \times 2.83\!\times\!10^{4}$
3. $18 \sin \frac{\pi}{5}$
4. $\ln(200)$
5. $\log_{10}(1000)$
6. $\sqrt{17}$
7. $\sqrt[3]{17}$
8. $2.14^{3.1 + 7.8}$
9. $e^2$

```{webr-r}


```



## Storage

We often will want to give names to computed objects.

* I use the strange word "object" because there are different kinds of computationally constructed things, e.g. numbers and functions among several others. (For instance, in QR2, you will sometimes create "simulations.")

* The computer syntax for giving a name to an object involves the "storage arrow" `->`. Here, I'll store the *value* 5.3 under the name `b`. The name always goes on the RHS of `<-`.

```{r}
b <- 5.3
```

Note that when you store an object, the object is not printed.

To recall the named object from storage, just use the name as a command or as part of a command. For instance:

```{r}
b
b + 17
```

IN-CLASS EXERCISES:

1. Store the value $\sqrt{22}$ under the name `billy_bob`. Then confirm by calculating `bill_bob` squared.
2. Why is $y^4 = 19$ not a valid storage expression? Fix it to express the intent.
3. Can `=` be used in place of `<-`?

```{webr-r}

```



## Errors

In response to an ill-formed computer command or some other troubling condition, R will cancel the computation and display an error message. For instance, here is an expression that refers to a name that is not yet in use:

```{r error=TRUE}
bb
```

On some web browsers, the webr-chunk error messages are not shown. That's a bug, and I'm trying to figure out what to do about it. For now, I can only apologize and give you a heads up.

**Error messages are your friend**. Admittedly, it is the kind of friend who you only welcome under special circumstances and otherwise avoid. The friend's [affect is offputting]{style="color: red;"} and intimidating. Try to overcome being affected by that. Also, the friend mostly mumbles. It takes work to feret out the valuable hint that your friend is trying to provide.

In-class EXERCISES:

1. What happens if you use the name `billy bob` to hold the value $\cos(22)$? After observing the error message, fix it.

```{webr-r}


```

2. Here is a command intended to create a function `francis()`:

```{webr-r}
francis() <- makeFn(y ~ 3 * y^2 - 4)
```

Figure out what's wrong and fix it.





## Graphs of functions

Graphing functions of one variable and setting the graphics domain.

- `domain(x = 0:10)`
- `slice_plot(x^2 - 3*x + 2 ~ x, domain(x=-5:5))`

In-class EXERCISES:

```{webr-r}


```

1. Plot out each of the pattern-book functions on a suitable domain. pnorm(), dnorm(), exp(), sin(), sqrt(), log(), 

2. Define a `recip()` function using `makeFun()`. 

3. Define an `identity()` function using `makeFun()`. (The identity function returns its input unaltered.)

4. Define a `power_law()` function using `makeFun()`. Example of a power-law function: $y^{2.4}$
