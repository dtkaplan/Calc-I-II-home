[picked up from Thursday's class]

## Assembling new functions from existing ones (Chapter 9)

Widely used ways to combine functions to create new ones:

1. Linear combination
2. Function multiplication
3. Function composition
4. Piecewise definition (and the `ifelse()` function.)

## Chapter 11: Fitting features

Input- and output-scaling heuristics for a handful of pattern book functions 

Note that the output scaling is a form of LINEAR COMBINATION.

- Exponential

This is as far as we got on Friday.

- Sin

- Gaussian & sigmoid
