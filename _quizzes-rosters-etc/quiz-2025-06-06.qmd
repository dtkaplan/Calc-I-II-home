This quiz is about the simple dynamical system

$$\partial_t x \equiv y, \ \ \ \ \ \partial_t y \equiv -x .$$

`r Q()` Draw the nullclines of the system on the graph plane below. Make sure to label clearly which is the x-nullcline and which is the y-nullcline.

`r vspace(2)`

Double check to make sure you haven't reversed the the nullclines. Hint: the coordinate point $(x = 1, y = 0)$ is on one of the nullclines. 

`r vspace(1)`

`r Q()`  Draw in flow arrows on each of the nullclines to each side of the origin. (There will be 4 flow arrows altogether.)

`r vspace(1)`


`r Q()`  Draw in another four flow arrows, one in each of the four quadrants of the plane.

`r vspace(1)`

`r Q()` Bye eye, draw a plausible trajectory for the flow, starting at whatever initial condition you choose (but **not** $(x=0, y=0)$).

`r vspace(1)`

`r Q()`  Still referring to the differential equations listed at the beginning, consider the time series $x(t) = \sin(t)$ as a **candidate** solution starting at the initial condition $(x = 0, y = 1)$. Use anti-differentiation to find the corresponding $y(t)$.

`r vspace(1)`

`r Q()` Again, referring back to the original differential equations, m   bodify the differential equations so that $x(t) = A \sin(\omega t)$ and its corresponding $y(t)$ are solutions, where $\omega$ describes the frequency of the oscillation. Write the modified equations here.

`r vspace(4)`

`r vspace(4)`

Turn the sheet over for an extra-credit problem.

`r vspace(10)`

**Extra credit**: @fig-pendulum shows another dynamical system, a pendulum bob at the end of a rigid rod hung from a pivot. The state is (angle, velocity). Angle 0 means the bob is directly below the pivot. Angles $\pm$180 put the bob straight above the pivot. Positive velocity corresponds to a counter-clockwise swing.

Dynamics of a pendulum
:::

`r vspace(1)`

`r Q()` Draw a trajectory from the initial condition where the angle is -120$^\circ$ and the velocity is zero. (Note: the initial angle is *negative*.)

`r vspace(2)`

`r Q()` Draw in the angle- and velocity-nullclines. They may have multiple segments. 

`r vspace(2)`

`r Q()` Mark each of the fixed points in the graphic domain and indicate whether they are stable or unstable.
