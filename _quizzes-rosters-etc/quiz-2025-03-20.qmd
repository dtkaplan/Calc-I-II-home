[**Question 6.1**]{.underline}: 

<!--#exr-drill-Quiz-2-11-->
Which of these is a positive-going zero crossing of $g(t)$ where $$g(t) \equiv \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}t-3\right)\ ?$$

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Quiz-2-11
#| show_hints: true
#| inline: true
1. $t=15/2\pi$ [correct hint: Excellent! This makes the $\frac{2\pi}{5}t$ component go to 3, which cancels out the -3. ]
2. $t = 2 \pi/15$ 
3. $t = 3$ [ hint: Notice that the argument is **not** $\frac{2\pi}{5}(t-3)$. ]
4. None of the above 
```



[**Question 6.2**]{.underline}: 

<!-- exr-drill-M01-5-->
What is the **change** in the value of $f()$ when the input goes from 2 to 4?     
Assume $f(x) \equiv 2 x + 1$    

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-M01-5

```


[**Question 6.3**]{.underline}: 

<!-- exr-drill-M01-6-->
What is the **rate of change** in the value of $f()$ when the input goes from 2 to 4?     
Assume $f(x) \equiv 2 x + 1$   

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-M01-6
#| show_hints: true
#| inline: true
1. -2 
2. -4 
3. 2 [correct]
4. 4 [ hint: You've calculated the net change, not the rate of change. ]
5. 9 
```


[**Question 6.4**]{.underline}: 

```{r echo=FALSE}

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Dimensions-17
#| show_hints: true
#| inline: true
1. L [correct]
2. T [ hint: Remember, the output of $\sin()$ is dimensionless. ]
3. L/T [ hint: Remember, the output of $\sin()$ is dimensionless. ]
```

 

 

[**Question 6.6**]{.underline}: 

Which one of these is **not** the derivative of a pattern-book function?   

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Pattern-book-derivs-14
#| show_hints: true
#| inline: true
1. Reciprocal [ hint: The reciprocal is the derivative of the logarithm. ]
2. Zero [ hint: Zero is the derivative of the constant function. ]
3. One [ hint: The constant function 1 is the derivative of the identity function $x$. ]
4. Sigmoid [correct hint: right-o There is some function whose derivative is the sigmoid, but it is not a function that we've discussed and it is not much (or ever!?) used in modeling. ]
```



[**Question 6.7**]{.underline}: 

<!--exr-drill-Polynomials-3-->
Imagine a second-order polynomial in three inputs: $x$, $y$, and $z$, like this: 
$$b_0 + b_x x  + b_{xy} xy + b_{xz} xz + b_{xx} x^2 + b_z z\ +$$ 
$$ \ \ \ \ \ + b_y y + b_{yy} y^2 + b_{zz} z^2\ .$$ 
All of the possible second-order (or less) terms are shown, except for one. Which term is missing?  

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Polynomials-3
#| show_hints: true
1. the interaction between $y$ and $z$ [correct]
2. the quadratic term in $z$ 
3. the linear term in $y$ 
4. the constant term 
```


[**Question 6.8**]{.underline}: 


```{r echo=FALSE}

<!--exr-drill-Scales-2-->
What is the correct form for the relationship shown in @fig-power-law-neg?

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Scales-2
#| show_hints: true
1. $g(x) \equiv 10 x^{-2}$ [ hint: When $x=0$, the ln(output) is 10. This isn't the same as saying the output is 10. ]
2. $g(x) \equiv e^{10} e^{-1.5 x}$ [ hint: Check the slope again ]
3. $g(x) \equiv e^{10} x^{-2}$ [correct hint: right-o Isn't it a decaying function of $x$? ]
4. $g(x) \equiv e^10 x^{-1.5}$ [ hint: Check the slope. ]
```


 

 

 

 

 

 

[**Question 6.9**]{.underline}: 

Suppose $a = 25$ft and $d = 1$meter

Is this combination dimensionally valid? $$\sqrt[3]{a^2 d}$$ Why or why not?

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Dimensions-5
#| show_hints: true
1. Invalid. You cannot raise a dimensionful quantity to a non-integer power. [hint: You can always raise a dimensionful quantity to an integer power. And, if the result of raising to the non-integer power is to produce dimensions that have integer powers, that is valid, too. ]
2. Valid. $a^2 d$ is a volume: L$^3$. The cube root of L$^3$ is L. [correct]
3. Invalid. 25 feet squared is 625 square feet. It makes no sense to multiply square feet by meters. [hint: Why not? 625 square-feet meters is a volume. It has dimension L$^3$. Admittedly a strange unit, but no stranger than the "acre-foot" used to measure agricultural irrigation. ]
```


[**Question 6.10**]{.underline}: 


```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-rev2-04
#| fig-cap: "A bump function"

           axis.title = element_text(size = 16))
```

<!--exr-drill-Quiz-2-8-->
One of the following choices is the standard deviation of the function graphed in @fig-rev2-04. Which one?

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Quiz-2-8
#| show_hints: true
#| inline: true
1. 0 [ hint: A gaussian with 0 standard deviation would be infinitely narrow and infinitely high! ]
2. 1 
3. 2 [correct]
4. 3 [ hint: Remember the rule of thumb---half-width at half-height ]
5. 4 
```


[**Question 6.11**]{.underline}: 

Engineers often prefer to describe sinusoids in terms of their *frequency* $\omega$, writing the function as $\sin(2 \pi \omega t)$, where $t$ is time. 

What is the dimension of $\omega$? 

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Dimensions-18
#| show_hints: true
#| inline: true
1. T$^{-1}$ [correct hint: Nice. A common unit of frequency is Hertz (Hz), sometimes called "cycles per second."]
2. T [hint: This would mean the input to $\sin()$ has dimension T$^2$. But $\sin()$ only makes sense for a dimensionless input.]
3. T$^2$ [hint: This would mean the input to $\sin()$ has dimension T$^3$. But $\sin()$ only makes sense for a dimensionless input.]
```


[**Question 6.12**]{.underline}: 

Which pattern-book function is the **anti-derivative** of the gaussian $\text{dnorm()}$? 




[**Question 6.13**]{.underline}: 

What is $\partial_{x} \ln(x)/x^2$? (Hint: A simple trick will turn the division into multiplication!) 

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Deriv-rules-12
#| show_hints: true
1. $-2 x^{-1} \ln(x)$ 
2. $-2 x^{-3} \ln(x)$ 
3. $x^{-3} \left(1 - 2 \ln(x)\right)$ [correct]
4. $-2 x^{-3} \left(1/x - 1\right)$ 
```

 

 

 

[**Question 6.14**]{.underline}: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-pieces-03
#| fig-cap: "A wiggly function"
#| out-width: "60%"
f3 <- makeFun(ifelse(abs(x) > 1, x, x^3) ~ x)

  gf_theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
           axis.title = element_text(size = 16))
```

<!--exr-drill-Piecewise-3-->

Which of the following tilde-expressions could be used to generate the graph in @fig-pieces-03?

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Piecewise-3
#| show_hints: true
1. `ifelse(x > 1, 1, x^2) ~ x` 
2. `ifelse(x > 0, sin(x), x) ~ x` 
3. `ifelse(abs(x) > 1, x, x^3) ~ x` [correct]
4. `ifelse(abs(x) > 1, x^3, x) ~ x` 
5. `ifelse(abs(x) > 1, x, exp(x^2)) ~ x` 
```



[**Question 6.15**]{.underline}: 

Which of the following shapes of functions is **not** allowed? If the shape is allowed, make a tiny drawing of the shape next to the item.

1. Increasing and concave up. 
2. Decreasing and concave up. 
3. Increasing and concave down. 
4. Decreasing and concave down. 
5. None of them are allowed. 
6. All of them are allowed. 

[**Question 6.16**]{.underline}: 

1. Which of the following is the reason that $$\displaystyle{\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\sin (1/x)}$$ does not exist?

```{mcq}
#| label: csc4-1
#| show_hints: true
1. Because no matter how close $x$ gets to $0$, there are $x$'s near $0$ for which $\sin(1/x) =1$, and some for which $\sin (1/x)=-1$. [correct]
2. Because the function values oscillate around $0$ [ hint: They do oscillate. But oscillation is OK so long as the amplitude of the oscillation goes to zero. ]
3. Because $1/0$ is undefined. [ hint: The point of defining something as a $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}$ is to avoid setting the input exactly to 0. ]
4. all of the above 
```



[**Question 6.17**]{.underline}: 

You're not expected to get this one, but write down an idea about how you might go about finding the answer.

Find the derivative of $g(x)^{f(x)}$

 

 

 

 

 

 

[**Question 6.18**]{.underline}: 

Using  $f'()$ and $g'()$ to stand for the derivatives $\partial_x f(x)$ and $\partial_x g(x)$, write down the derivative w.r.t. $x$ of each of these functions:


1. $A f(x) + B$

 

2. $f(x) g(x)$

 

3. $f(x) + g(x)$

 

4. $\log(g(x))$

 

5. $\exp(f(x))$

 

6. $f(g(x))$ 

 

7. $1/g(x)$ 

 

8. $\left| \ g(x))\ \right|$




[**Question 6.19**]{.underline}: 

$H()$ is the Heaviside ("step") function. Write down the derivative of $H(x) g(x)$.

 

 

[**Question 6.20**]{.underline}: 

For the function $$h(u) \equiv \ln(a^2 u - \sqrt{b})$$ is the interior function linear? 

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-M08-3
#| show_hints: true
#| inline: true
1. Yes [correct]
2. No [ hint: Although $a^2$ and $\sqrt{b}$ appear to be nonlinear, they are not the inputs to the function. The function input is named $u$, and that appears in a strictly linear manner. If we had written the interior function as $9 u - 4$, you would have had no problem recognizing it as linear. We can equally well write this as $3^2 u - \sqrt{4}$; it is the same function and it is still linear in $u$. ]
```

 

 

 

 



[**Question 6.21**]{.underline}: 

Which of these is $\partial_t \left(ln(6)+t^4-e^t\right)$?

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Deriv-rules-12a
#| show_hints: true
1. $\frac{1}{6}+4t^3-e^t$
2. $\frac{1}{6}+4t^3-e^{-t}$
3. $4t^3-e^{-t}$
4. $4t^3-e^t$ [correct] 
```

 

 

 

[**Question 6.22**]{.underline}: 

Which of these is a reasonable definition of a derivative?   

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Pattern-book-derivs-13
#| show_hints: true
1. A derivative is a function whose value tells, for any input, the instantaneous rate of change of the function from which it was derived. [correct]
2. A derivative is the slope of a function. [hint: For functions that aren't straight lines, it does not mean anything to speak of "the slope" because the slope varies from place to place. Always remember that the derivative of a function is another **function**.]
3. A derivative is a function whose value tells, for any input, the instantaneous change of the function from which it was derived. [hint: Not a bad start but a crucial word was left out. It should say, "the instantaneous **rate** of change". "Instantaneous" and "rate" go hand in hand.]
```

[**Question 6.23**]{.underline}: 

What is $\partial_y \partial_x \left[\ a_0 + a_1 x + b_1 y + c x y + a_2 x^2 + b_2 y^2 \ \right]$?  

```{mcq}
#| label: PD18
#| show_hints: true
#| inline: true
1. $c$  [correct] 
2.  $2 a_2$ [hint: $a_2 x^2$ doesn't survive $\partial_y$.]
3.  $2 b_2$ [hint: $b_2 y^2$ doesn't survive $\partial_x$.] 
4.  $0$ 
```


[**Question 6.24**]{.underline}: 

::: {#fig-rev2-05}
![](www/rev2-05.png)

An imagined terrain.
:::


You are standing in the terrain shown in @fig-rev2-05, the position $(x=-1,y=4)$. In terms of the compass points (where north would be up and east to the right), which direction points most steeply uphill from where you are standing. 

```{mcq}
#| label: drill-Quiz-2-19
#| show_hints: true
#| inline: true
1. NE [correct]
2. SE 
3. SW [ hint: it is steep in this direction, but **downhill**! ]
4. NW 
```

 

 

 

 


 

 



[**Question 6.25**]{.underline}: 

::: {#fig-6-25-terrain}
```{r echo=FALSE}
f <- mosaicCalc::doodle_fun(~ lat & long, seed=9372)
contour_plot(20 + f(long, lat) ~ long & lat, domain(lat = -5:5, long = -5:5)) |>
  gf_refine(coord_fixed())
```

A different terrain.
:::

On @fig-6-25-terrain, mark all local maximum with the letter "T" and all local minima with the letter "B." 

 

 

 

[**Question 6.26**]{.underline}: 

Again with respect to @fig-6-25-terrain, draw 10 gradient vectors at scattered points of your choice. Make the length of the vector (roughly) proportional to the steepness of the terrain. 

[**Question 6.27**]{.underline}: 

Using @fig-6-27-gradient mark every local maximum with "T" and every local minimum with "B." 

::: {#fig-6-27-gradient}
```{r echo=FALSE}
f <- doodle_fun( ~ x & y, seed = 999)
gradient_plot(f(x, y) ~ x & y, domain(x=-5:5, y=-5:5), npts=15) |>
  gf_refine(coord_fixed())
```

A gradient field.

[**Question 6.28**]{.underline}: 

For the function $f(x)$, write down the first five terms of the Taylor polynomial expansion around $x_0 = 0$. Use prime notation, for instance $f''(x)$

 

 


[**Question 6.29**]{.underline}: 

Here is a Taylor polynomial for a familiar, even, pattern-book function, centered on $x_0 = 2$.

$$1 - \frac{(x - 2)^2}{2!} + \frac{(x-2)^4}{4!} + \ldots$$

Paying attention only to the zeroth-order and second-order terms (that is, ignoring $(x-2)^4/4!$ and everything that might follow), expand out the second-order term algebraically and re-write the result in standard polynomial order (that is, $a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2$).

Is the resulting function even around $x=0$? Briefly explain the reasoning behind your conclusion?


 

 

[**Question 6.30**]{.underline}: 

::: {#fig-6-28-along-contours}
```{r echo=FALSE}
f <- doodle_fun(~ x & y, seed = 1023)
