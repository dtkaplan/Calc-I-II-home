[Steve Strogatz's $pi$-day article](https://www.nytimes.com/article/pi-day-math-geometry-infinity.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)

Talking about convergence.

Number systems: 

currency: pounds, shillings, pence

time: hours, minutes, seconds

angle, degrees, minutes seconds: show a decimal lat/long location on Google Maps

How do we know that 3.14159265358979 ... converges to a finite number. It's the sum of an infinite number of things:

$$ 3 x^0 + 1 x + 4 x^2 + 1 x^3 + 5 x^4 + 9 x^5 + 2 x^6 + \ ... \text{ at } x=1/10$$

This looks like a function. (It is a function, it's just that we are evaluating it at x=0.1 to get $\pi$)

a polynomial approximation found by matching the derivatives. 


## Convergence of an infinitely long polynomial:

$$\sum_{0}^{n\rightarrow \infty} x^{-n} = 1 + x \sum_{0}^{n \rightarrow \infty} x^{-n} $$
so

$$ \sum_{0}^{n\rightarrow \infty} x^{-n} \left(1 -x \strut\right) = 1$$

so 

$$ \sum_{0}^{n\rightarrow \infty} x^{-n} = \frac{1}{1-x} $$
