```{r include=FALSE}
library(mosaicCalc)
```

An unexpected snow day! I'm going to have to improvise a little.

Here are a few chunks for me to work in on my tablet

```{webr-r}

```


```{webr-r}
# Chunk 2

```


```{webr-r}
# Chunk 3

```

The only change is a different R function, `gf_point()` that plots a response variable against a **single** explanatory variable, e.g., `Galton <- gf_point(height ~ mother)`. There


## Activity

1. Plot some data on the screen. 

2. Copy it over to your board.

3. Draw a version of a basic modeling function that aligns with the data. 

Some pattern-book functions will work better than others. `fitModel()` makes you choose the function, then does the rest automatically. 

If we expanded `fitModel()` so that it would go through a large library of functions, try them all, and then pick the one that works best overall, we would be doing "*machine learning*." (There would be additional technicalities, which are discussed a little in Spiegelhalter Ch. 4. "Cross-validation" is one of the methods that can come into play, but we won't talk about that in this Calculus course.)

How do you think the computer could do what you do by eye automatically? We need a framework and a procedure.
