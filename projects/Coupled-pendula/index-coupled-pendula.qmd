## Pendulum dynamics

## The forced pendulum and resonance

Using exponential ansatz and confirming numerically

## Two pendula

First set up the DEs with independent pendula, then add in coupling terms.

## Many pendula

How strong a coupling will produce synchrony?

Can driving one pendulum drive them all?
