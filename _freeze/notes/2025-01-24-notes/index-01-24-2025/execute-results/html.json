Linear combination\n2. Function multiplication\n3. Function composition\n4. Piecewise definition (and the `ifelse()` function.)\n\n## Chapter 11: Fitting features\n\nInput- and output-scaling heuristics for a handful of pattern book functions \n\nNote that the output scaling is a form of LINEAR COMBINATION.\n\n- Exponential\n\nThis is as far as we got on Friday.\n\n- Sin\n\n- Gaussian & sigmoid\n\n\n",
