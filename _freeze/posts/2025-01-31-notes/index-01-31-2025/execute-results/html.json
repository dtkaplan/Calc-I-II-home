AVOID terms that you don't need.\n\n[Got to here on Thursday]\n\n\n## Why do bicycles have gears\n\nSimilar to the reason that gasoline cars have gears, but electric cars don't need them.\n\nBike speed $B$ increases with power applied. You can also think of it as foot speed multiplied by gear ratio.\n\nMuscle Force and speed: There is a decreasing relationship between the force a muscle can apply and the speed of contraction. (Extension is similar, but we need a $\\Lambda$-shaped function to put both contraction and extraction into one function.)\n\nLet's keep it simple, use a low-order polynomial, say F(v) = 1 - v. (I'm writing only the sign of the coefficients to make the notation as clean as possible, but in general it should be $F(v) = a - b\\ v$).\n\nPower: Power is Force times speed. Work out the dimensions.\n\nGraph the function: multiply the F(v) decreasing function by v, that is\n\n$Power(v) = v (1-v)$\n\nAn optimal speed to maximize power!\n\nASIDE: Gas engines: power proportional to RPM times efficiency of each fuel \"event.\" Efficiency also has an optimal: need to give the gas enough time to burn, but too much leads to \"detonation.\" Ergo, cars have gears.\n\n\n### Extending the example\n\nFind the speed of a bicycle as a function of road steepness ($s$) and gear ($g$) selected.\n\n- There are of course many other factors that play a crucial role: power ($p$) provided by the cyclist, wind speed, tire inflation, and so on. \n\n- In our model today, we will consider these other factors fixed. \n\n### Add in rider power\n\n- Always put in the linear time.\n\n- Are there interactions with other variables?\n\n- Is there an optimum power?\n\nAs a first pass, we don't need to consider terms of order three or higher. Examples:\n\n- $p s g$\n\n- $p s^2$ or $p g^2$, let alone $p^2 s^2 g$ (fifth order) and such.\n\n## Operations on Functions\n\nAll three of these seek a specific value for the input. That is, these operations \n\n- take a function as input\n- produce a quantity as output\n\n1. Zero-finding\n\n2. Optimization\n\n3. Iteration\n\n\nAfter break, we'll start on the famous operations of calculus: differentiation and anti-differentiation. These both take a function as input and produce a function as output.\n\n",
